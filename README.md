# Logistic-Regression-Analysis-with-Larson-and-Loschky-2009-
Logistic Regression with data from my first, first-authored paper

The study examines the contributions of differt parts of our visual field to categorizing an image's setting (for example, an image could depict a "City", "Park", or "home").  The python code briefly summarizes the study and its findings.  Afterwards, I use Python and the statsmodel library to analyze the data using a logistic regression.  This repository contains the raw data in a .csv file and the python code in an .ipynb.
